General

 Messenger is developed by one main developer, with a few people helping from time to time, mostly with translations.

Privacy Policy ("Policy") describes how information obtained from users is collected, used, and disclosed.

By using  Messenger, you agree that your personal information will be handled as described in this Policy.

Information being collected

Simple SMS Messenger does not store any personally identifiable information on our servers. Your phone number is uploaded to the mobile carrier so that they can handle sending and receiving SMS and MMS.


The `READ_PHONE_STATE` permission is needed in cases the user has multiple SIM cards inserted, so he is able to toggle between them.

Changes to the Policy

If the Policy changes, the modification date below will be updated. The Policy may change from time to time, so please be sure to check back periodically.
