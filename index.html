Information being collected

Simple SMS Messenger does not store any personally identifiable information on our servers. Your phone number is uploaded to the mobile carrier so that they can handle sending and receiving SMS and MMS.

The `SEND_SMS` permission is used to send sms to the user

The `READ_PHONE_STATE` permission is needed in cases the user has multiple SIM cards inserted, so he is able to toggle between them.
