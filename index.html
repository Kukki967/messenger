General

Simple SMS Messenger is developed by one main developer, with a few people helping from time to time, mostly with translations.

Privacy Policy ("Policy") describes how information obtained from users is collected, used and disclosed.

By using Simple SMS Messenger, you agree that your personal information will be handled as described in this Policy.

Information being collected

Simple SMS Messenger does not store any personally identifiable information on our servers. Your phone number is uploaded to the mobile carrier so that they can handle sending and receiving SMS and MMS.

The `READ_CONTACTS` permission is used at getting contact names from phone numbers, also at showing contact suggestions. It is optional, the app works without it too.

The `READ_PHONE_STATE` permission is needed in cases the user has multiple SIM cards inserted, so he is able to toggle between them.

Changes to the Policy

If the Policy changes, the modification date below will be updated. The Policy may change from time to time, so please be sure to check back periodically.
